        <p> Walif Hasan:

            First blog post should start with a bang. Make it something amazing, something that breaks the mold. It doesn’t matter if your only reader is your unemployed cousin with too much time on his hands. Make the first several blog posts so amazing that everybody you contact over the next few weeks is envious of that unemployed cousin – they all want the time to read your next post.
            
            This strategy works only if you contact a lot of people, and the best ways to do that are:
            
            1. Get your post shared on social media. Get it in front of a lot of eyeballs. That’s one of the things I do to help bloggers grow their audiences. I get their posts tweeted and retweeted, shared on FaceBook and Google Plus and elsewhere. The big mistake many bloggers make is thinking they can put up a quick-and-dirty post and leave it to me to get it shared. Wrong! The sharing works for you only if the content is amazing.
            
            2. Comment on other blogs, related blogs. Make the comments bang on about the post you’ve just read. Add something they’ve left out. Share your experience on a point they made. Correct the author (very respectfully) if you disagree with a point. Engage with the blogger, and you’ll engage by extension also with his or her readers.
            
            3. Get active on blogger networks, such as Kingged and BizSugar, as well as FaceBook Groups and Google Plus Communities. You want to have blogger friends who will work with you to promote your posts, reach new audiences and collaborate on content.
            
            And that’s how to make your first blog post a success, and – more importantly – how to use that first post to make your new blog a success.</p>

       <p>The quick, brown fox jumps over a lazy dog. DJs flock by when MTV ax quiz prog. Junk MTV quiz graced by fox whelps. Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex! Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz. Brick quiz whangs jumpy veldt fox. Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack. Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. Sex-charged fop blew my junk TV quiz. How quickly daft jumping zebras vex. Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. Quick, Baz, get my woven flax jodhpurs! "Now fax quiz Jack!" my brave ghost pled. Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed. Flummoxed by job, kvetching W. zaps Iraq. Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk. A very bad quack might jinx zippy fowls. Few quips galvanized the mock jury box.

        Yet another blog post
        Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

                    <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams,
                         he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
                          He lay on his armour-like back,
                           and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
                            slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
                         The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.</p>
